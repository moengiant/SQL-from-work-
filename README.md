# SQL example from when I worked at ion exhibits
This was one of many SQL querys that I created while workinf at ion exhibits.
It pulled data from a SQL database and wrote it to a text file that could then be read into a dataflex database using DOS - yes DOS
The owner of the company had been using dataflex way before I worked there and had built all sorts of reports using the flex db. So it was eaiser to export and then inport the data into the flex db than to recreate 100's of automated reports.
