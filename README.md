# TSQL example from when I worked at ion exhibits
This was one of many SQL querys that I created when I worked at ion exhibits.
It pulls data from a SQL database used by propritary .net program and wrote it to a text file that could then be read into a flex database using DOS - yes DOS.
The owner of the company had been using flex way before I worked there and had built all sorts of report around the flex db. So it was eaiser to export the data and then inport the data into the flex db than to recreate 100's of automated reports. Bit of a hack but the owner loved flex and DOS.
